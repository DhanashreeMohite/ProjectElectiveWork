Observations:

a. affinity for all processes = same:

        1. Without Semaphore, jst counting not printing
        --> Med is not able to pre-empt low. both medium and high waiting to run.
        
        2. Without Semaphore,  counting with printing
        --> all processes running simultaneously
        
        3. With Semaphore, jst counting not printing
        --> Med is not able to pre-empt low.
        
        4. With Semaphore, counting with printing
        --> Medium and Low are printing simultaneously. Low is not taking any extra time to run.
        High is waiting till lock is available.
        
b. affinity for all processes = different:

        1. Without Semaphore, jst counting not printing
        -->  all processes running simultaneously
        
        2. Without Semaphore,  counting with printing
        --> all processes running simultaneously
        
        3. With Semaphore, jst counting not printing
        --> med and low are running simultaneously. high will start running after low releasing lock.
        
        4. With Semaphore, counting with printing
        --> med and low are running simultaneously. high will start running after low releasing lock.
